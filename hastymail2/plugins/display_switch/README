The display_switch plugin adds a display mode toggle to the main menu allowing
users to switch between normal and simple display modes. Add the following to
your hastymail2.conf file enable the plugin:

plugin = display_switch

Don't forget to rebuild the hastymail2.rc file after editing the hastymail2.conf.
Plugin configs are cached when you login so be sure to logout and back in to
enable the plugin.
